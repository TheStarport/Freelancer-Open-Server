FL Open Server Backlog

ARCHITECTURE
- Fix parsing of dependent elements so that there is no ordering dependency (ie. Gun blocks need Munition blocks, but the dependency fails if the Munition block is defined after the Gun block)
- Make sure Solars register first to avoid objid collisions with other SimObjects
- Not use the third part of the version number, seems to never be compatible if non-zero? x.x.??.x
- Add finer grained gui debugging.
- Modify DSAM/DSPM to manage and monitor server remotely.
- Public anticheat and client dlls. - Possibly should be done in C++ due to easy decompilation
- Plugin support?
- Move from ReactorEvents to C# event call functions for better performance
- Treat every update as async call and return results after ^
- Enable Jitter Physics to control collisions and zone presence

CRITICAL FUNCTIONALITY
- Way to measure load/lag per game thread and for all players
- Check that gun is mounted when accepting fireweapons events
- Damage on missile hit.
- Splash damage on mine/missile hit, with or without falloff
- Rocket muzzle?
- Support for multiple shield generators
- Support for multiple thrusters
- Damage in zone with less frequent updates
- Reputation management?
- Mines.
- Trade window
- Scan
- Radar
- Tractor
- Tradelane disruption
- Docking denied on reputation (jumpgate, tradelane behavior?)
- Ambient NPC spawns
- Patrol paths
- NPC chatter
- Missions
- Rumors in base

ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY
- Add dock chatter
- Distinguish dock responses (denied for too big vs reputation, etc.)
- Add dock queue management and change dock point selection to avoid putting two ships on the same point
- Danger/combat/death music
- Login/Logoff/Death messages
- Add a separate list for damaging/interfering zones to shorten loops
